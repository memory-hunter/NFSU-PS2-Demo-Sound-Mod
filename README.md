# NFSU-PS2-Demo-Sound-Mod
A mod for Need for Speed Underground replacing PC sounds with PS2 Demo sounds as heard [here](www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg_lWVMTgyg).

I picked out certain sounds which I replaced in the commercial release version of PC.

These sounds are:
- Turbo
- Shifting
- Backfire (Sparkchatter)
- NOS
- Menu

I excluded the engine sounds as they were simple pitch-ups and other miscellaneous sounds.

The changes are applied to high-end tuned cars, as the PS2 Demo only introduced tuned cars.

## Installation

The mod has a Powershell (.ps1) script for Installation and Uninstallation.

Drag and Drop the game folder or write the directory and confirm the action.
